## 1. Subscription Expiration and Grace Period

When a paid subscription expires and automatic renewal fails due to payment issues:

- Customers will enter a 14-day grace period.
- During this grace period, full access to clusters and services will be maintained.
- Customers will be notified immediately about the payment failure and the start of the grace period.

## 2. Service Access After Expiration

- Customers can continue to use their clusters during the 14-day grace period (Month 3 in the example).
- After the grace period, if payment is not received, cluster access will be restricted.

## 3. Cluster Preservation and Deletion Policy

- After the grace period, clusters will enter a "suspended" state for 60 days.
- During suspension:
  - Clusters will not be accessible but data will be preserved.
  - Customers can reactivate their subscription at any time to regain full access.
- If payment is not received within 60 days after suspension:
  - Clusters will be scheduled for deletion.
  - A final 7-day warning will be issued before permanent deletion.

## 4. Reactivation Process

- To reactivate a suspended account, customers must:
  - Update their payment method
  - Pay any outstanding balance
  - Choose a new subscription plan (if desired)

## 5. Data Retention and Recovery

- Data from deleted clusters will be retained for an additional 72 hours after deletion.
- During this period, customers can request data recovery by contacting support and paying a recovery fee.

## 6. Communication Timeline

- Payment failure: Immediate notification
- Grace period start: Day 1 notification
- Grace period end warning: Day 10 notification
- Suspension notice: Day 14 notification
- Deletion warning: 7 days before scheduled deletion
- Final deletion notice: Day of deletion

## 7. Prepaid Subscriptions

- For customers who have paid in advance, the grace period will begin at the end of their paid period.
- Example: If a customer paid for 2 months, the 14-day grace period would start at the beginning of month 3.

## 8. Account Reinstatement

- Customers can reinstate their account and recover their data at any point before the final deletion, subject to payment of all outstanding fees.
