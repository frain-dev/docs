Convoy has two license tiers, namely `Business` and `Enterprise`. This documentation will guide you on how to purchase a license, and configure the license key on your convoy instance(s)

environment variables, cli flags or config file.


## Prerequisites
You will need to register on our (Saas)[https://cloud.getconvoy.io]. After registering you must add a payment method and then navigate to the `Licenses` tab using the sidebar.
There you can select `Create a new License` and follow the steps. You will receive the license key in your mail not too long after.
To setup your convoy instances to use this license key, you must add to your instance configuration either by CLI flag, environment variables or config file.

```
Environment Variable: CONVOY_LICENSE_KEY
CLI flag: --license-key
Config file: {
        license_key: "BE32N-32..."
}
```

## Running the instance
After adding the license key config, you're good to go. Run the instance as you normally would and now you will access to the features of your license tier.
