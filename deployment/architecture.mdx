Convoy consists of several services working in tandem. Below is an architecture diagram and the traffic pattern.

## Components

Let's break down the image above by describing the important elements.

### Server

The API Server hosts Convoy's REST API that powers the dashboard, and all HTTP SDK functions.
When events are sent through the API, they are immediately enqueued to Redis,
where a worker picks it up and persists the events into the database, before dispatching the events.
We are currently iterating very fast and releasing new features often,
we try our best to make it backward compatible while shipping new exciting features.
When there are breaking changes we explicitly communicate them in the [Release Notes.](/releases-notes/version-8#release-highlights)

The API Server is a stateless service, and can be scaled horizontally.
We suggest that you deploy them behind a load balancer to properly distribute traffic among the instances.
See the CLI details [here](/cli-file/convoy#server).

### Agent

These instances are responsible for the following
#### Asynchronous Task Processing
Processing all asynchronous tasks in the queue.
These can range from important functions like processing webhook events to ancillary tasks like sending emails,
purging stale events ([retention policies](./configuration#configuration-reference)) etc.
These workers are designed to be stateless and can be scaled horizontally to increase the throughput of the entire system.

#### Ingesting from message brokers
These stateless workers are used to consume webhook events from [message brokers](/product-manual/message-brokers).
They poll source configuration from the database and consume events from the broker
and write it to the redis queue.

See the CLI details [here](/cli-file/convoy#worker)

### Egress

The egress service is an HTTP Connect Proxy
that is directly responsible for sending webhook events to the client endpoints.
These services provide two major benefits: static ips, because it is a connect-proxy,
we are able to maintain a predefined set of IP address on all requests forwarded to client endpoints.
Secondly, the egress service prevents Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
by creating a blocklist of URLs that cannot receive requests to prevent malicious users
from triggering unexpected behaviours in our cloud environment.

By its nature, the egress service should be deployed in a static environment
(i.e., specific VMs with IP Address pre-defined).
Depending on your availability requirements,
we suggest you deploy at least three instances
and place a load balancer in front of the egress services to distribute traffic evenly.

## Third-Party Dependencies

### PostgreSQL 15+
Postgres is used as for the following
- Primary data store
- Search backend

### Redis 6+
Redis is used for a number of operations, namely
- Caching
- Job queueing
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breaking
