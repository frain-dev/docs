Filtering is used to decide what events an endpoint will receive based on the webhook event payload. The subscription filter is an enriched JSON syntax for both simple and complex filters (such as special logical and arithmetic operators `$or`, `$gte`, `$eq`).

Subscription filters can be configured from the subscriptions' page:

The filters are configured in the **Filter Schema** editor and the event payload in the **Event Payload** editor to validate the schema.

## Simple filters

Simple filters directly match keys to values, and they can be nested. They can also match items in an array.

#### Direct object match

This filter is used to validate simple JSON webhook payloads.


```json  Simple object match filter
{
	"event_type": "created"
}

```

#### Nested object match

This filter is used to validate nested webhook payloads.


```json  Nesting object match filter
{
	"event": {
		"type": "created"
	}
}

```

#### Array contains match


```json  Array contains match
{
	"dish": {
		"ingredients": "rice"
	}
}

```

## Complex filters

Complex filters contain more logic such as logical operators and special operators. Complex filters are employed to filter events using one or more conditions, e.g., `$or` logical operator filter.

#### $neq filter

This filter matches event which directly does not match the event type in the webhook payload.


```json  $neq filter
{
	"event": {
		"$neq": "created"
	}
}

```


<Frame>![$neq subscription filter](/images/subscription-ne-filter.png)</Frame>

#### \$or and \$and filters

This filter is used to match multiple conditions defined in the schema.


```json  $or filter
{
	"$or": [
		{
			"cities": "london"
		},
		{
			"type": "weekly"
		}
	]
}

```


```json  $and filter
{
	"$and": [
		{
			"age": {
				"$gte": 10
			}
		},
		{
			"$or": [
				{
					"type": "weekly"
				},
				{
					"cities": "lagos"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}

```

#### Array Contains filters

This filter is used to match keys where the value can be a range of values. It can be used in place of `$or` if you are comparing on the same field. The opposite of this operator `$nin` can be used to match keys where the value is not in a range of values.



```json  $in filter
{
	"operation": {
		"$in": ["created", "deleted"]
	}
}

```




```json  $nin filter
{
	"operation": {
		"$nin": ["updated", "truncated"]
	}
}

```


<Frame>![$in filter](/images/subscription-in-filter.png)</Frame>

#### Arithmetic filters

These filters match events based on arithmetic operators. For example, the filter below will match all events where the age is greater than 1. The operators supported are `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`



```json Arithmetic filter
{
	"age": {
		"$gt": 1
	}
}

```


#### Array positional filters

These filters match events with payloads that are array either in the root or nested.



```json  Array positional filters
{
	"$.venues.$.lagos": "lekki"
}

```

#### Regex filters

These filters match events with payloads that match the supplied regex.



```json  Regex filters
{
	"event_type": {
		"$regex": "^es_[a-zA-Z]+$"
	}
}

```

**NB:** Convoy only supports filters with arrays nested up to 3 levels i.e. `$.a.$.b.$.c.$.e` will throw an error

Here's a full list of the supported filters:

|$in     |array                       |checks if an array contains a value        |
|$nin    |array                       |checks if an array does not contain a value|
|$or     |array of conditions         |matches an array of conditions             |
|$and    |array of conditions         |matches an array of conditions             |
