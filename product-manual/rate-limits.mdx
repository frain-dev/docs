## Ingress Rate limits
This controls how many events Convoy can ingest per second
This is configured by setting the `CONVOY_INGEST_RATE` env var.
This value limits the number of:
- Messages read off message brokers
- Events created via API (direct, dynamic, fan-out, broadcast).

Reaching this limit will cause requests to receive a `429 (Rate Limit Exceeded)` error response for APIs that create events.

## Egress Rate Limits
This controls how many events Convoy can send per second.
There is no instance wide configuration, instead egress rates are configured per endpoint.
(This might change in the future)

## HTTP API Rate Limits
This controls how requests per second Convoy can process.
This includes:
- Headless control plane APIs (used for managing project resources).
- Ingress APIs

Reaching this limit will cause requests to receive a `429 (Rate Limit Exceeded)` error response from all APIs.
> Requests made to the Convoy instance via the UI don't count towards rate limits.

## Technical Details

Rate limits are stored in Redis and are prefixed by `rate:`
