Convoy exports metrics about the state of events received and sent via Prometheus

## Enabling Metrics
Metrics are currently in beta, and aren't enabled by default. To enable them, you need to
- Enable the `prometheus` feature flag using `CONVOY_ENABLE_FEATURE_FLAG=prometheus`
- Set the metrics backend env var `CONVOY_METRICS_BACKEND`

Either one of the two code blocks below will work.

```shell enabling convoy metrics using flags
convoy worker --metrics-backend=prometheus --enable-feature-flag=prometheus
```

```shell enabling convoy metrics using env vars
export CONVOY_METRICS_BACKEND=prometheus
convoy worker --enable-feature-flag=prometheus
```
