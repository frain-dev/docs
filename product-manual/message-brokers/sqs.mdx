title: Amazon SQS
---

Convoy supports ingesting events from SQS queues. This is currently only supported in [outgoing projects](../../product-manual/organizations-and-projects#outgoing-project).

## Connecting to your SQS queue
To ingest events using Amazon SQS, follow the steps outlined below:
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an IAM User for authenticating with the SQS Queue and attach the AmazonSQSFullAccess policy to the user">
        <Frame>![create IAM user](/images/create-sqs-user.png)</Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Frame>![attach AmazonSQSFullAccess policy](/images/attach-sqs-policy.png)</Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Under the security credentials tab for the IAM user, generate a new Access Key">
        > **Take note of the Access Key and Secret Key generated**

    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Frame>![create CLI access key](/images/cli-access-key.png)</Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a SQS Queue and specify the ARN of the IAM user under the access policy">
        <Frame>![create sqs queue](/images/create-sqs-queue.png)</Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Frame>![add the IAM user under access policy](/images/access-policy-iam-user.png)</Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Going back to Convoy">
        Supply your `Access Key`, `Secret Key`, `Queue Name` and `Default Region`.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Ingestion Options
There are two ways to ingest events into Convoy from your SQS queue:
- Format the payload using the structure below as a guide and write it to your queue.
  ```json5 reference payload
   {
      "event_type": "string, required",
      "data": "object, required",
      "custom_headers": { // optional
          "x-convoy-message-type": "single",
          "sample-header": "sample-value"
      },
      "idempotency_key": "string, optional",
      "owner_id": "string, optional", // if included, the event is sent to all endpoints with the owner-id
      "endpoint_id": "string, optional" // if included, the event is sent to a single endpoint
   }
    ```
  > If `x-convoy-message-type` set to **broadcast**, the event will be sent to all endpoints in the project, ignoring both the `endpoint_id` and `owner_id` values.

For a full list of reference payloads, see [our guide on ingesting events](../../product-manual/events-and-event-deliveries#ingesting-events)
- Send your arbitrarily formatted event payloads to your queue and use Convoyâ€™s transform functions to mutate them at the point of ingestion.
  ```js transform function
  function transform(payload) {
      return {
          "endpoint_id": "",
          "owner_id": "",
          "event_type": "sample",
          "data": payload, // payload contains arbitrary message data read from your queue
          "custom_headers": {
              "sample-header": "sample-value"
          },
          "idempotency_key": ""
      }
  }
    ```

## Things to note
- Messages are read of the topic one-by-one by each worker reading off the queue.
- Acknowledgements are done per message.
- Ingestion is rate-limited (50 per second), and this can be configured by setting the `CONVOY_INGEST_RATE` environment variable.
