Convoy supports ingesting events from RabbitMQ queues. This is currently only supported in [outgoing projects](../../product-manual/organizations-and-projects#outgoing-project).

## Before Connecting to RabbitMQ
To connect your RabbitMQ instance, you need to supply:

- The **hostname and port** of the RabbitMQ cluster (e.g., localhost:5672).
- The **queue name** from which to pull messages.
- The **number of workers** specifying the number of consumers polling messages from the queue.
- (Optional) **Dead Letter Exchange (DLX)**, to route unprocessable messages to a specified exchange. Convoy does not declare this DLX.
- **Virtual Host (vhost)**, where your queue and exchange are located.
- **Username** and **password** for authentication.

### Bind Exchange (optional)
RabbitMQ queues can be bound to exchanges, enabling selective message routing based on a **routing key**. You can specify an exchange name and routing key to filter messages sent to your queue.

## Authentication
Authentication is optional and can be set up using **username** and **password** if required. Additional configurations, such as **SSL/TLS**, can be enabled or disabled depending on your RabbitMQ setup.

## Connecting to RabbitMQ
To set up RabbitMQ as an event source in Convoy, follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Complete the RabbitMQ Source Form with the required details">
        This includes specifying:
        - **Hostname** and **Port**
        - **Queue Name**
        - **Number of Workers**
        - **Virtual Host**
        - (Optional) **Dead Letter Exchange (DLX)** and authentication credentials

    </Step>
    <Step title="View the created RabbitMQ source in the sources list">
        After submitting, your new RabbitMQ source should appear in the list of event sources.

## Ingestion Options
Convoy provides two ways to ingest events from RabbitMQ:

1. **Direct Payload Ingestion**: Use the following payload structure as a guide for formatting:
 ```json5 reference payload
 {
    "event_type": "string, required",
    "data": "object, required",
    "custom_headers": { // optional
        "x-convoy-message-type": "single",
        "sample-header": "sample-value"
    },
    "idempotency_key": "string, optional",
    "owner_id": "string, optional", // if included, the event is sent to all endpoints with the owner-id
    "endpoint_id": "string, optional" // if included, the event is sent to a single endpoint
 }
    ```
 > If `x-convoy-message-type` is set to **broadcast**, the event is sent to all endpoints in the project, ignoring both the `endpoint_id` and `owner_id` values.

2. **Arbitrary Payload Transformation**: For custom payload formats, use Convoyâ€™s transform functions to modify the payload at the point of ingestion.
 ```js transform function
 function transform(payload) {
     return {
         "endpoint_id": "",
         "owner_id": "",
         "event_type": "sample",
         "data": payload, // arbitrary data from the queue
         "custom_headers": {
             "sample-header": "sample-value"
         },
         "idempotency_key": ""
     }
 }
    ```

## Things to Note
- Each worker reads messages one-by-one from the queue, with acknowledgments processed per message.
- Ingestion from RabbitMQ is rate-limited at 50 messages per second, configurable via the `CONVOY_INGEST_RATE` environment variable.
