import StaticIPsComponent from '/snippets/static-ips-component.mdx';

We wrote this document for webhook providers to copy and adapt to their own webhook 
delivery configuration. Most segments can be fully copied, a few others require you to
select the option for your docs. **Watch out for the tooltips and callouts.**


## What are webhooks?
Webhooks are a mechanism for notifying third-party applications about a change in their
account in real time. Oftentimes, APIs are able to respond immediately to API calls, but
not all the time, in scenarios like this, a webhook event is used to notify the third-party 
app via a Webhook URL. 


## Event Types
<Note> Find a way to document all your supported event types and their accompanying payload. 
Use the one below, only as a guide. </Note>

<CodeGroup>
    ```json invoice.created
    {
        "event_type": "invoice.created",
        "data": {
            "id": "inv_3234aei32489aie2o3245",
            "status": "created"
        }
    }
    ```

    ```json invoice.paid
    {
        "event_type": "invoice.created",
        "data": {
            "id": "inv_3234aei32489aie2o3245",
            "status": "paid"
        }
    }
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Retry Behaviour
Convoy supports two types of retry strategies: `linear`, and `exponential backoff`, based on your configuration you 
can use any of the below to communicate with your users.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linear Retry Strategy">
    <Note> Swap out the specific delay and duration according to your config. </Note>
    ```text
    In production, if your endpoint does not respond with a 2xx, 
    we continue to retry the event every n seconds for a 
    maximum of n hours.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Exponential Backoff Strategy">
    <Note> Swap out the specific delay and duration according to your config. </Note>
    ```text
    In production, if your endpoint does not respond with a 2xx 
    status code, we continue to retry the event with an exponential 
    retry schedule.
    ```
  </Tab>

## Webhook Verification
There are two ways you can verify webhooks from <Tooltip tip="replace this with your company name.">provider</Tooltip>. Let's take a look at both methods 
and what safe guards they provide.


### Static IPs
With this verification method, you can configure your firewalls to receive webhooks 
from only the following IP addresses, while blocking out the rest.

<Note> If you're a cloud customer, select the IP addresses from the region your cluster is deployed</Note>

<StaticIPsComponent />

### Signature Verification
With this verification method, we're able to determine if the webhook came from
<Tooltip tip="replace this with your company name.">provider</Tooltip>, and has not been 
tampered with in transit. We use [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io), and they provide SDKs 
for the following languages:

<Note> 
Make sure to substitue the `encoding`, `hash`, and `header` for your configuration.
Supported values for them are:
- `encoding`: `hex`, `base64`.
- `hash`: `SHA256`, `SHA512`.
- `header`: provider specific. E.g. `X-Paystack-Signature`.

## Consuming webhooks best practices.

<Note> You can freely copy and paste this segment. </Note>

1. Always return early. If you have a long running process that you'd like to executed
preferably push that to a background job to process, and return quickly with a `2xx`. 
2. Favour Idempotent processing. All webhooks are delivered with a `X-Convoy-Idempotency-Key`
header which can be used for Idempotent processing.
3. Default to `HTTPS` endpoints. Webhooks are endpoint exposed to the internet, for safety, 
we default to `HTTPS` only URLs, and validate the certs.
