sidebarTitle: Use Convoy as a Proxy
---

Usually to use a Convoy, you'd need to create an endpoint, and then create a 
subscription, then send events. This isn't the easiest migration path, especially
for users who already have a webhook system in-place, and are looking to offload
the delivery to a better delivery system. 

In this guide, I will show you how to use Convoy as a proxy to deliver webhooks 
with one API. No need for creating any resources upfront. Let's dive in!

### Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Have a Convoy instance running">
    The first step is to ensure you have a Convoy instance running. You can either 
    [spin up](../deployment/install-convoy) one or create on from our [cloud platform](https://cloud.getconvoy.io/signup). 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an outgoing project">
    This feature is only available to outgoing webhooks project. So you'd need to ensure you've 
    created one. You can check [here](../product-manual/organizations-and-projects#outgoing-project) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push event. ðŸŽ‰">
  ```bash terminal
  curl --request POST \
  --url {base_url}/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/events \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "{endpoint_url}",
    "secret": "{endpoint_secret}",
    "data": "{data}",
    "event_type": "{event_type}",
    "event_types": ["{event_type}"],
    "idempotency_key": ""
}'
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


### Limitations

While this endpoint enables you get going super fast, there are a few limitations, you 
should be aware of, such as:

- **Limited Subscription Configuration:** This endpoint, only supports `event_type` filtering with the `event_types` array.
It doesn't provide advanced [payload filtering](../product-manual/subscriptions#filters). To configure, such filters, check this 
[endpoint](../api-reference/subscriptions/create-a-subscription).
- **Limited Endpoint Configuration:** This doesn't enable you to set attributes like `http_timeout`, 
`rate_limit_duration`. To see what is fully possible check this [endpoint](../api-reference/endpoints/create-an-endpoint).
