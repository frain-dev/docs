title: "Versioning"
---

Convoy’s API is designed to be backwards compatible from scratch. The aim was not to break your apps with every new update to the API. Not all Convoy [releases](https://docs.getconvoy.io/release-notes/releases) have breaking API changes; you can view the list of all versions with breaking changes [here](#breaking-changes).

For every new release that includes breaking API changes, we create a new version, and set the new version to the default API version. The current default version is `2024-01-01`. To lock your instance to a specific version, specify the `api_version` in your `convoy.json`. You can also make per-request calls by specifying the header: `X-Convoy-Version` in the request header.


## Backwards-compatible changes
Convoy considers the following changes to be backwards-compatible:

- Adding new API resources.
- Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
- Adding new properties to existing API responses.
- Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as object IDs, error messages, and other human-readable strings.
	- This includes adding or removing fixed prefixes (such as `en_` on endpoint IDs).
 	- Make sure that your integration can handle Convoy-generated object IDs, which can contain up to 255 characters. For example, if you’re using MySQL, store the IDs in a `VARCHAR(255) COLLATE utf8_bin` column (the `COLLATE` configuration provides case-sensitivity during lookups).
- Adding new event types
	- Make sure that your webhook listener gracefully handles unfamiliar event types.

## Compatibility Matrix 
The table below shows the Convoy version we introduced new API versions.
