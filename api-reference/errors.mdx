Convoy's API is RESTful, and as such, we use conventional HTTP status 
codes to indicate the status of every request.

## HTTP codes
| Code | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `201 Created`      | Resource was created successfully    |
| `400 Bad Request`  | The request failed due to an unacceptable, most commonly an invalid parameter. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | A request to a protected endpoint did not have a valid API Key. |
| `404 Not Found`    | Resource does not exist.                          |

## Sample Error Response

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "invalid endpoint scheme"
}
```
