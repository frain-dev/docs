Convoy has three license tiers, namely `Community` which is the free plan, `Business` and `Enterprise`. This documentation will guide you on how to purchase a license,
and configure the license key on your convoy instance(s). The pricing of all tiers can be found [here](https://getconvoy.io/pricing).

            {
                "database": {
                    ....
               },
                "redis": {
                    ...
                },
                "license_key": "",
                "server": {
                    .....
                }
            }
            ```

        </Step>

        <Step title="License key in environment variable" stepNumber="c">

            $ CONVOY_LICENSE_KEY="B20329...." convoy server
            ```
        </Step>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Running the Instance
Once you've added the license key configuration, you're ready to proceed. Simply start the instance as usual, and you will now have access to all the features included in your license tier.

## Upgrades
Upgrading your license will not remove any features you currently have. In addition, you'll gain access to the new features provided by your upgraded license.

## Downgrades
When you downgrade your license, you'll lose access to the paid features of your previous license. You'll only have access to the features included in your current license. If you downgrade to the community plan and have more than two projects (the limit for the community plan), Convoy will freeze all projects except two, which will be randomly selected. The frozen projects will be restricted from actions that write new data, such as creating events, endpoints, or sources.
You will be able to view your dashboard per usual.
