title: Webhook Retries
---

import GetStarted from '/snippets/get-started.mdx';

Webhook retries are the mechanism of reattempting to deliver webhook events over a specified period, ensuring they eventually reach their destination. Given the inherent unreliability of network connections, retries play a critical role in guaranteeing that events are successfully delivered, even in cases of temporary disruptions.

Convoy is a flexible webhook gateway that can be configured to use either `linear` or `exponential backoff` retry strategy.

### Comparing Retry Algorithms for Webhooks
Retry algorithms aren’t specific to webhooks, rather they’re a general technique used to solve various problems in distributed systems. But what would be appropriate retry configuration for a webhook provider? Most providers offer retries with exponential backoff. Let’s assess three retry strategies for webhooks

- Linear Retry
- Exponential Backoff
- Exponential Backoff with capped duration.

An ideal webhook retry strategy should meet the following requirements: [1]

1. The first 5 retries should happen in less than 30 minutes.
2. The maximum retry should happen not greater than 24 hours.

Why? Webhooks power real-time notifications across apps. The keyword here is real-time. As many things in software engineering, that word is over loaded and can mean different things depending on the context. In high-frequency trading even a few microseconds of delay can result in significant financial losses. But this isn’t the case for a vast majority of webhooks. For example, a webhook from Linear to Slack with a 1 minute delay wouldn’t result in any significant financial lose or serious disruption to your business, especially when the delay is as a result of failure in initial attempts.

Here’s the configuration for each retry strategy compared:

| Strategy | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Linear Retry | + 1 hour |
| Exponential Backoff | `(delaySeconds * 2^attempt) + jitter` |
| Exponential Backoff with Capped Duration | `min(delaySeconds * 2^attempt, maxRetrySeconds) + jitter` |

With the following parameters

- **Base:** 20 seconds
- **Jitter: +/-** 10%
- **Delay Growth**: `delaySeconds * 2^attempt`
- **Retry Limit:** 20

To provide additional context, the formula is defined as follows:

- **Delay Growth**: The delay doubles with each retry attempt, allowing for a rapid increase in wait time for successive failures (`delaySeconds * 2^attempt`).
- **Capping**: The new strategy incorporates a default (but configurable) cap of **7200 seconds (**`maxRetrySeconds`) to prevent indefinitely long wait times, thus ensuring the system remains responsive and efficient.
- **Jitter**: A `jitter` value is added to each calculated wait time, providing an additional layer of randomness that further helps distribute the retry attempts over time.

We wrote a script to run these comparisons [here](https://github.com/subomi/compare-retries). Feel free to tweak the input and analyse the output.

### The Results

Given our requirements above, let's evaluate the two retry strategies shown in the graph based on these criteria:

|  | Linear Retry | Exponential Backoff with Capped Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Requirement 1** <br /> <br /> The first 5 retries should happen in less than 30 minutes | The graph shows that the linear retry strategy takes about 18,000 seconds by the 5th retry. **18,000 seconds** is approximately **5 hours**, which exceeds the 30-minute limit for the first 5 retries.  | The graph shows that the capped duration strategy takes about 601 seconds by the 5th retry. **601 seconds** is approximately **10 minutes and 1 second**, which doesn’t exceed the 30-minute limit for the first 5 retries.  |
| **Requirement 2** <br /> <br /> The maximum retry should happen not greater than 24 hours | By the 20th retry attempt, the linear strategy takes about **72,000 seconds**, which translates to **20 hours**, which doesn’t exceed the 24 hours rule. | By the 20th retry attempt the capped duration strategy takes about **89559 seconds**, which translates to **24 hours 52 minutes** which slightly exceeds the 24 hours rule. |

We didn’t include pure exponential backoff strategy above because of how ridiculous the chart looks compares to the rest.

### Appendix

1. These numbers aren’t a hard and fast rule, rather they’re a framework to reason about what the latency requirements for your webhooks are and tune them for that purpose. This would optimize your entire delivery process to save $$$ in compute. Feel free to use our script — [compare-retries](https://github.com/subomi/compare-retries).
